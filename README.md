Front End and some Back End
Here I learnt more about JavaScript and learnt to use several different key words and functions.
At first I faced a lot of trouble in fetching the API but then I resolved it. I had to watch the video almost 4 times to understand what next.
For now this is the last project. I am planning onto building something more but this time I'll use all the skill that I acquried and maybe I will be able to call it my own 100%.
